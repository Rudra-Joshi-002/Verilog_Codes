Verilog module implements a simple digital clock that tracks time continuously in hours, minutes, and seconds.
It increments time with every clock cycle and handles reset functionality to initialize the clock's state.
The clock operates in a 24-hour format, resetting after reaching 23 hours 59 mins and 59 secs to start a new day.
